# Hough-Transform

## Mentioned

* This repository includes line-detection and circle-detection of houghtransform.

* Each detection includes Python and C++ versions.



## Explaination

In **Hough-CircleDetection**, there are two algorithms:

* One is analog **line-detection**, and three accumulators are established;

* Another is **HoughGradient**.

However,in this method of **HoughGradient**, the algorithm is not generalized, but only one circle can be detected.

We can also make visualization of accumulator.
